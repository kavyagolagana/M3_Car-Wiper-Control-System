# TITLE: M3_Car-Wiper-Control-System
## REPORT


Our Automatic rain operated wiper system works well with rain sensor. As future extraction work the same  can be  carried out  by different types of sensor. As far as  accuracy of the system is concerned it is more accurate than conductive, optical sensor etc. But the reason for not using those named sensors is because of their higher cost.  The sensor unit mounts discretely to the interior of the windshield while providing increased detection area, improved accuracy, and a lower cost than the pre-existing optical unit. This sensor has been designed to be able to easily replace optical units, as it mounts in the same location of the vehicle, on the interior of the windshield, and relays the same control signals to the BCM of the automobile. Its less power consumption, been free from wear and tear as well  as  it been  possible to operate  manually/automatically by  providing on/off switch  all make this design a very useful and advantageous working model.Thus the advantage of this project, which  is  the automatic rain sensor  wiper, is  cost effective, sustainable,  and user-friendly. This  design brings about a result from  either one of two paths, costing down the current automatic rain sensor wiper and creating an innovative new design. Both of these paths required  a  more broad knowledge of  appropriate materials  that could be  utilized in creative ways in automatic rain sensor wiper construction.
