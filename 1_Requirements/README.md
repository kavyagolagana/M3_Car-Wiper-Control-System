## INTRODUCTION
In recent  years researchers  are  trying to  develop  automobile industry more  and more for safety,  reliability,  flexibility  and  entertainment  by  modern  computing  and  electronics. Consumers are expecting their car to be voice controlled, auto driven and GPS assisted visual directions for driving. Almost all consumers first go for checking electronic gadgetry before selecting  a  car. Bluetooth  hands  free,  mp3 player,  video/  TV  players are  even  common phenomena for a car. These interactions with gadgetry could be very dangerous distraction for  the  driver. Distraction  or  taking  drivers  eye  off  the  road  may  cause  devastating accidents. The National  Highway and Transportation  Safety  Association reports  that twenty six  percent of  all car  accidents  are caused by distractions due to talking on cell phones, eating while driving, and other similar distractions that take a driverâ€˜s focus off the road. The distraction considered in this project is the adjustment of wiper speed based on the intensity of precipitation falling. The number of accidents caused by distraction can be slightly reduced by eliminating the need for drivers to adjust  wiper  speed.  The  traditional  wiper  system  requires  driver  constant  attention  in adjusting the wiper speed using manual switch. And sometimes dust particles floating in the air are covered in the windscreen during moving vehicle which could be another cause of accident. The manual adjustment of the wiper and windscreen washing spray distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause of accident. This project is up to minimize the drivers work by setting up automatic control system for windshield mountings which are wiper, and rain sensor. With drivers exposed to an ever increasing number of accidents, automatic rain-sensing wiper system, dust cleaning system and automatic sun visor system could be an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel. By using rain sensing device the wiper can be automated and light sensor can be useful to regulate the sun visor without even touching it. The pivotal concern is to render more attention of the driver on the roadThe automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile a The system was developed to  mitigate driving distractions and  allow drivers to focus on  their primary task of driving. The distraction eliminated with the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving in precipitation. The few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather conditions coul

### WHAT

A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.

### WHERE

The present invention relates generally to a wiper control system for an automotive windshield wiper, which automatically controls the operating speed of the wiper in dependence upon rain conditions.

### WHY

Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor. Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.

### WHEN

If the humidity level or the rain, dew deposited on the windshield is more, than accordingly wiper will move. In that case, the system will turn on the wiper motor to activate at high speed using the driver circuit. If the level of humidity is low, then the wiper motor is activated at low speed.

### HOW

Virtually all automotive wipers are controlled by a microprocessor. Many wiper systems in cars today use a rain sensor to detect the speed at which the raindrops are falling on the windshield. A microprocessor evaluates the signals from the sensor to calculate the speed at which the wipers should move.

### ADVANTAGES

* It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption. 
* It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary.

### DISADVANTAGES

* Smart Wiper Control System uses infrared sensor which is implemented in the latest cars but it has few disadvantages. 
* The One is space occupied on the screen is small and the second (main) drawback is need of clear wiping on the windscreen, where the sensor is placed.
